I think this is the first step we take to improve our applications and possible to create another one to help the people who are still struggling with technologies and that we can make it easier not just for them, but also for us to access."

I know this is almost impossible to do, but this is always been my dream, because I know one of the downfall of the rapid advancement of our technology is the damage we caused to our nature, and since we are one of the source why it is being destroyed, why not use this platform to help solve the problems.
